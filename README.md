The essays in this repository are organized with each in its own directory.  Many directories contain supplementary material.  All material in this repository is ASSAIL licensed unless otherwise noted.  See:

Each essay is classified into one of five categories:

* α

> These essays are complete and correct to best of my knowledge.

* β

> These essays are substantially complete and correct.  They may contain minor errata and there may be noticable lacunae, but the material present is consistent and usable.

* γ

> These essays are first drafts that may contain serious errors.  They are certainly incomplete.

* δ

> These essays are formative - they are ε class essays that have been fleshed out enough to contain some useful material.  Like ε essays, in the absence of broader interest, they may never be completed.

* ε

> These essays are speculative ideas that may be partially or wholly incorrect.  The essays are merely sketches and in the absence of any broader interest, may never be completed.  They typically arise when some whimsy inspires me to think about something for a day or two.

In the subsequent sections, the essays in this repository are grouped by classification, providing a link to the prefered distribution format, together with a short descriptive paragraph.
